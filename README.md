Hello World,

My name is Jamie a.k.a. Peanut, I am an amateur coder attempting to improve my knowledge by following a Swift 3 programming course on Udemy created by Mark Price of Devslopes.

I have previously learned the basics of coding on a college course I took in 2008 based around Microsofts Visual Basic (6) (so a looong time ago!).

This is my first experience with using GitHub....
